# binswap

## What is this

`binswap` is a cli tool that helps you quickly switch between different versions of a binary.

## Why do I need this

I have found myself wanting a tool such as this in the following cases:

- Frequently swapping between projects that use a different version of a given binary

- Attempting to track down a bug in one of several versions of a given binary

## How do I use this

**Add new binary version:**
`bs <binary-alias> <binary-version> <path-to-binary>`

**Switch to binary version**
`bs <binary alias> <binary-version>`
